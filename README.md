lobbyist
========

`lobbyist` is another practice project I am working on. In its current incantation, it is meant to be a very simple, short text-based game, simulating a congressional hearing.

# RULES

You are a lobbyist up against a congressional panel composed of five legislators, who may be either supportive or unsympathetic to your cause. In order to further your legislative goals, you must treat each congressperson differently, either calming their opposition or encouraging their support.

By either downplaying or emphasizing the issues the members of congress bring up, you can sway congress to your side... or against it.

# FUTURE DIRECTION

I eventually want this to become a fully-fledged simulator game, including public involvement and the ability to manage several issues.
