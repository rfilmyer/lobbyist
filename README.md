lobbyist
========

`lobbyist` is another practice project I am working on. In its current incantation, it is meant to be a very simple, short text-based game, simulating a congressional hearing.

## Intro

You are a lobbyist up against a congressional panel composed of legislators who may be either supportive or unsympathetic to your cause. In order to further your policy goals, you must treat each congressperson differently, either calming their opposition or encouraging their support.

By either downplaying or emphasizing the issues the members of congress bring up, you can sway congress to your side... or against it.

## Rules

You (the lobbyist) answer questions from a panel of five legislators who either support or oppose your plan. They will each ask you about the details of your plan. You get a quick briefing before you begin on where each representative stands, but when you're in the hot seat it's up to you to remember where each member stands.

When you are asked a question, you have the choice to either minimize the issue or play it up. Play up issues to galvanize your supporters, and minimize them to assuage the concerns of opponents.

Your final result will depend on how effectively you answered the questions of the panel.

## Future Direction

I eventually want this to become a fully-fledged simulator game, including public involvement and the ability to manage several issues.
